MIS User Story Design Document
==============================

The next step after it doing something that i script against to do
stuff is making it actually do the stuff itself. User stories define the
functionality the product requires, and can be beneficial in creating a
preliminary FAQ section.

Terminology:
------------
node: single instance of mis, from the perspective of running it in a network
maintenance time: a moment in time when the program can be restarted
filedata: actual contents of a media file
metadata: information about the contents of a media file

Roles:
------
administrator: administrator of the mis system, responsible for one or
              multiple nodes


User stories:
-------------
template: "As <who> <when> <where>, I <what> because <why>."

As administrator, at chosen times, from the console, I need to be able
to import all media data into mis because mis should handle all media
data.

As administrator, at chosen times, regardless of location, i want to be
able to check integrity of the stored data because in huge volumes,
bit rot becomes an issue

As administrator, when corruption is found, regardless of location, I
want the possibility of automatic correction where possible because I
only care about corrupt data when good data is unavailable

As administrator, at maintenance time, i want to be able to set a
minimum redundancy of filedata per node

As administrator, at any time, i want to be able to set a
minimum redundancy of filedata per network of mis system

As administrator, when configuring a node, i want to be able to set
levels of trust in other nodes

As user, at any time, though some ui, I want to access my media
filedata because i want mis to to able to serve media data

As user, at any time, through some ui, I want to search my media
metadata because i can't remember all my media id's

As user, at any time, through some ui, I want the ability to add
metadata because some metadata cannot be discovered

As user, at any time, through some ui, I want the ability to change
metadata because metadata can be incorrect
